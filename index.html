<p>Rewatched for the first time in ages and even better than I remembered it, which is saying something since I’ve always loved this film.</p>
<p>The ending was longer than I remembered. For some reason, I thought the film ended with Joel and Clementine meeting on the train – this does not count as a spoiler, even if you ignore the film being more than 20 years old – but I guess there’s a nice irony to my memory of the film being imperfect!</p>

<p>Another solid 4 stars from me, following on from yesterday&rsquo;s 4 star for <a href="https://kennethyau.net/2026/01/01/marty-supreme.html">Marty Supreme</a>.</p>
<p>Very different film to Marty Supreme in that it&rsquo;s way more conventional and feel-good while – mild spoiler alert – not being completely feel-good.</p>
<p>But also similar in being biopics. That said, Marty Supreme, while ostensibly a biopic and based on an actual person, is clearly taking liberties with the story and is more fiction than fact. If I&rsquo;m reading correctly, the story in Song Sung Blue is what actually went down, which is amazing to me, having seen the film.</p>
<p>Anyway, while not quite Barbenheimer, the 24-hour double bill of Marty Supreme and Song Sung Blue was a nice contrast of intellectual slapstick comedy and old-fashioned unashamed entertainment squarely aimed at your heart and tear ducts.</p>

<p>A solid 4 stars from me. For the first act, I was utterly gripped and enchanted and thought this was heading easily for a 5-star rating, but I felt it sagged a bit in the second act and could have done with a bit of editing. There&rsquo;s one particular strand of the story I believe could have been excised without losing anything. That said, it picked up marvellously in the third act.</p>
<p>Timothée Chalamet should definitely be in the running for an Oscar for this though I believe he will/should (deservedly) miss out to Michael B Jordan, for the latter&rsquo;s performance in Sinners.</p>

			 <p>Hello, world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new year, so of course I&rsquo;m going to start a new blog.</p>
<p>Lesson learned from previous attempts: not to overthink the first post; just lance that boil with a quick post like this one, and crack on.</p>
